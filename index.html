      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have always been terrible at the "about me's" but here it goes; I am currently a Deli Assistant manager but I have worked a TON of different jobs in my 29 years from construction to culinary.  Though I am really hoping that this bootcamp will be the last career change.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up between Gurnee, Illinois and the Upper Pennisula of Michigan.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Video Games, Warhammer, learning anything on the Computer.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Honestly anything that can provide for me and my family and still allow me to enjoy life.  I mean *cough* Web Devlopment of course.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Chicago</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love learning new things on computers and I had previously thought that this was a career that was gated behind a 4 year degree. And I mean what is better than learning the language that computers speak.</p>
